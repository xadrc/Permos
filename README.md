### DESCRIPTION

A comparison of missing values imputation procedures for ground temperatures time-series forecasting

### AIM

* Estimate the impact of missing values in alpine permafrost subsurface temperatures time-series on short-term forecasts and retroactively compare different procedures for missing values imputation

### ACHIEVEMENTS

* Automated importation of ground temperatures time-series at five chosen depths from twenty-eight PERMOS boreholes in the Swiss Alps
* Interpolation of missing values using four different imputation procedures
* Fitting exponential smoothing state space predictive models to retrodict completed time-series
* Backtesting predictive models with historical temperature recordings and using standard deviations of the
residuals to compare missing values imputation procedures

### DATA

* temperature time-series at different depths from 28 swiss high-alpine boreholes from the Swiss Permafrost Monitoring Network
